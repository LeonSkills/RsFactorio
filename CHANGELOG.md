### Changes
- Changed all mod changelogs so they can be read out in game
- Renamed RsUtility to RsBase
- `build_mods.py` now accepts command line arguments to update only some mods, force increase version numbers, make version number changes optional (so we don't go into the 100s anymore) and makes it possible to increase major and minor version number by script

### Added
- Dependencies are now automatically added to info.json. Add them in dependencies.json in the /mods folder
